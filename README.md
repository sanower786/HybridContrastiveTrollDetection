# 🧠 Hybrid Contrastive Learning with Text-Derived Psycholinguistic Features for Robust Troll Detection

📖 Overview
This repository contains the official implementation of the research paper:

**Hybrid Contrastive Classification with Text-Derived Psycholinguistic Features for Troll Detection**  
Author: Sanower Alam et al.

Online trolling undermines healthy online discourse and presents major challenges for
automated content moderation. This work proposes a **Hybrid Contrastive–Classification
Framework** that integrates contextual language embeddings with text-derived
psycholinguistic and stylistic features, optimized through a dual-loss learning strategy.

The framework is designed to improve both **classification performance** and
**probability calibration**, without relying on user-level metadata or platform-specific
signals.

## 🔐 Information Leakage Prevention
All auxiliary features used in this repository are extracted strictly at the **comment
level**. No user-level metadata, temporal posting statistics, author histories, or
label-derived attributes are used at any stage of training or evaluation.

Dataset splits are created **prior to feature extraction**, ensuring that no information
from validation or test samples leaks into training. This design guarantees that reported
performance reflects genuine generalization rather than dataset artifacts.

## 📊 Key Results
The proposed framework achieves:

- **Accuracy:** 97.0%  
- **F1-Score:** 0.96  
- **ROC–AUC:** 0.99  
- **ECE (Expected Calibration Error):** 0.009  
- **Brier Score:** 0.027  

These results outperform multiple baselines, including Logistic Regression, SGD
Classifier, BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa and The LLM baseline is evaluated independently to preserve the
design focus on contrastive hybrid representations.
