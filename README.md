Online trolling undermines healthy online discourse and presents major challenges for automated moderation.

This work introduces a \*\*Hybrid Contrastive–Classification Framework\*\* that combines contextual language embeddings, psycholinguistic and behavioral features, and dual-loss optimization to enhance robustness and calibration in troll detection systems.



The framework achieves:

\- \*\*Accuracy:\*\* 97.0%

\- \*\*F1-Score:\*\* 0.96

\- \*\*ROC–AUC:\*\* 0.99

\- \*\*ECE (Expected Calibration Error):\*\* 0.009

\- \*\*Brier Score:\*\* 0.027



This significantly outperforms baseline models such as Logistic Regression, SGD Classifier, BERT, and DistilBERT.
