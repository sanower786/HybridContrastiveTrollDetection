0,disclaimer  i think obama should nominate someone  and the senate should hold confirmation hearings but this article does not accurately describe most republicans  statements on this issue  the vast majority of republican statements  although  notably  not the cruz one cited in the article  carefully phrase the issue as whether a nominee has been  nominated and confirmed  in the president s last year in office  although kennedy was confirmed in 1988  he was nominated by reagan at the end of 1987  so he does nt fall under this definition 
0,either way the process will be dragged out until after the elections the gop have the votes in the senate to say no and would rather gamble in 2016 they at least had the decency to inform everyone of what exactly they re doing this time around
